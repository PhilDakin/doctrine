"text": "Celtic Studies, an academic discipline focusing on the study of the Celts, includes work from well-known authors such as Polybius, Posidonius, Pausanias, Diodorus Siculus, Julius Caesar, and Strabo. The modern form of Celtic studies finds its origins in the 16th and 17th centuries, a time marked by the rediscovery, publication, and translation of many classical authors. This field experienced a significant breakthrough in Celtic linguistics with the publication of 'Archaeologia Britannica' in 1707 by the Welsh scholar Edward Lhuyd. It was Lhuyd who first identified the Gaulish, British, and Irish languages as belonging to the same linguistic family. Further linguistic analysis was undertaken by James Parsons, who compared a 1000-word lexicon of Irish and Welsh, deducing that they shared a common origin. He also made comparisons of the numerals in many other languages."
